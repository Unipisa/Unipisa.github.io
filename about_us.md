# General Information


The Unipisa GitHub Organization was first started in the beginning of February, 2019. 

 Undoubtedly, this 'GitHub Organization' idea is still very young and has a long way to go. 

At it's core, the Unipisa GitHub Organization is meant to facilitate collaboration between Univerit√† di Pisa programming projects. 

We want students, faculty, and staff to share their on-going projects through the GitHub Organization, whether they be research projects, hobby projects, or anything in-between.


# How can I contact the GitHub Coordinators?
