#### **Q**: What are open-source licenses for?  
**A**: Typically, when you make a creative work (this includes code), the work is under exclusive copyright by default. This means that, unless a license specifies otherwise, nobody can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without the risk of take-downs.  However, GitHub’s [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/){:target="_blank"} state that public repositories are allowed to be viewed and forked by others.  These terms are not sufficient for the kinds of collaboration that people usually seek on a public code host, such as experimentation, modification, and sharing.  However, open-source licenses do allow for experimentation, modification and sharing with few restrictions.  While it is typically assumed GitHub projects have an implicit open-source license attached to them, that is not technically the case. This may therefore drive away potential contributors. Click [here](https://choosealicense.com/no-license/){:target="_blank"} for more information.

#### **Q**: Is an open-source license required for my repository?  
**A**: While it is not required, it is highly recommended to include one. It’s important to consider the potential consequences of both including and not including an open-source license, and what doing so means for other users who may want to contribute.

#### **Q**: Which open-source license should I use?  
**A**: There are many different, popular open-source licenses that serve unique purposes. While we cannot make that decision for you, we have posted a short list of popular open-source licenses to consider. For more in-depth information on license, visit <https://opensource.org/licenses>{:target="_blank"}. For help on deciding which license to use, visit <https://choosealicense.com/>{:target="_blank"}.
